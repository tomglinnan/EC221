Welcome! This is where I'll post any bonus resources for EC221 (MT and LT) for the classes that I teach

Please email me if you have any questions!

* **MT week 2:** [Slides](MT2.pdf) on an introduction to the course and on Stata

* **Bonus Resources:** These were written by me for previous courses I've taught - one in LSE Life, and another run by the LSE Economics society
	1. [Point of Stats](Point of Stats.pdf) - this is a presentation which talks about hypothesis testing, how it's applied to OLS, and what estimation _is_. Might be helpful if you want to see how many of the tools learnt in the first half of MT fit together (though as I explain, this is all about analysing correlation instead of causation)
	2. Testing](q4q.pdf) - this is a short pdf walking through what hypothesis testing is, intended for those who've never studied statistics before. It might be helpful if you're stuck on this specific topic, as people often are

More coming soon!
