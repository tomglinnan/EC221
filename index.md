# EC221 Class Resources

Welcome! This is where I'll post any bonus resources for EC221 (MT and LT) for the classes that I teach

Please email me if you have any questions!

* **MT week 2:** [Slides](MT2.pdf) on an introduction to the course and on Stata
* **MT week 4:** [Some short OVB notes](Quick OVB Notes.pdf), in case I went through the chain rule analogy too fast!
* **MT week 6:** Two extra things this week
	* [A note on Robust Standard Errors](Robust SEs.pdf) - a few people were asking me about how these work, but unfortunately nearly all material online explains them using matrices. This note goes through what they are, why (and when) we should use them, and also shows how they're computed in a simple case (which doesn't require matrices). Remember: this material isn't examinable in MT, and we'll get back to it all properly in LT!
	* [A note on Interaction Effects](Interaction Effects.pdf) - people sometimes have problems with this the first time they see it, so I've added in my explanation of how they work and why we should care about them (to supplement Lecture 15)


* **Bonus Resources:** These were written by me for previous courses I've taught - one in LSE Life, and another run by the LSE Economics society
	1. [Point of Stats](Point of Stats.pdf) - this is a presentation which talks about hypothesis testing, how it's applied to OLS, and what estimation _is_. Might be helpful if you want to see how many of the tools learnt in the first half of MT fit together (though as I explain, this is all about analysing correlation instead of causation)
	2. [Testing](q4q.pdf) - this is a short pdf walking through what hypothesis testing is, intended for those who've never studied statistics before. It might be helpful if you're stuck on this specific topic, as people often are
